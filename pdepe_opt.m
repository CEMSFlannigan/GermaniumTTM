%PDEPE  Solve initial-boundary value problems for parabolic-elliptic PDEs in 1-D.
%   SOL = PDEPE(M,PDEFUN,ICFUN,BCFUN,XMESH,TSPAN) solves initial-boundary
%   value problems for small systems of parabolic and elliptic PDEs in one
%   space variable x and time t to modest accuracy. There are npde unknown
%   solution components that satisfy a system of npde equations of the form
%
%   c(x,t,u,Du/Dx) * Du/Dt = x^(-m) * D(x^m * f(x,t,u,Du/Dx))/Dx + s(x,t,u,Du/Dx)
%
%   Here f(x,t,u,Du/Dx) is a flux and s(x,t,u,Du/Dx) is a source term. m must
%   be 0, 1, or 2, corresponding to slab, cylindrical, or spherical symmetry,
%   respectively. The coupling of the partial derivatives with respect to
%   time is restricted to multiplication by a diagonal matrix c(x,t,u,Du/Dx).
%   The diagonal elements of c are either identically zero or positive.
%   An entry that is identically zero corresponds to an elliptic equation and
%   otherwise to a parabolic equation. There must be at least one parabolic
%   equation. An entry of c corresponding to a parabolic equation is permitted
%   to vanish at isolated values of x provided they are included in the mesh
%   XMESH, and in particular, is always allowed to vanish at the ends of the
%   interval. The PDEs hold for t0 <= t <= tf and a <= x <= b. The interval
%   [a,b] must be finite. If m > 0, it is required that 0 <= a. The solution
%   components are to have known values at the initial time t = t0, the
%   initial conditions. The solution components are to satisfy boundary
%   conditions at x=a and x=b for all t of the form
%
%       p(x,t,u) + q(x,t) * f(x,t,u,Du/Dx) = 0
%
%   q(x,t) is a diagonal matrix. The diagonal elements of q must be either
%   identically zero or never zero. Note that the boundary conditions are
%   expressed in terms of the flux rather than Du/Dx. Also, of the two
%   coefficients, only p can depend on u.
%
%   The input argument M defines the symmetry of the problem. PDEFUN, ICFUN,
%   and BCFUN are function handles.
%
%   [C,F,S] = PDEFUN(X,T,U,DUDX) evaluates the quantities defining the
%   differential equation. The input arguments are scalars X and T and
%   vectors U and DUDX that approximate the solution and its partial
%   derivative with respect to x, respectively. PDEFUN returns column
%   vectors: C (containing the diagonal of the matrix c(x,t,u,Dx/Du)),
%   F, and S (representing the flux and source term, respectively).
%
%   U = ICFUN(X) evaluates the initial conditions. For a scalar X, ICFUN
%   must return a column vector, corresponding to the initial values of
%   the solution components at X.
%
%   [PL,QL,PR,QR] = BCFUN(XL,UL,XR,UR,T) evaluates the components of the
%   boundary conditions at time T. XL and XR are scalars representing the
%   left and right boundary points. UL and UR are column vectors with the
%   solution at the left and right boundary, respectively. PL and QL are
%   column vectors corresponding to p and the diagonal of q, evaluated at
%   the left boundary, similarly PR and QR correspond to the right boundary.
%   When m > 0 and a = 0, boundedness of the solution near x = 0 requires
%   that the flux f vanish at a = 0. PDEPE imposes this boundary condition
%   automatically.
%
%   PDEPE returns values of the solution on a mesh provided as the input
%   array XMESH. The entries of XMESH must satisfy
%       a = XMESH(1) < XMESH(2) < ... < XMESH(NX) = b
%   for some NX >= 3. Discontinuities in c and/or s due to material
%   interfaces are permitted if the problem requires the flux f to be
%   continuous at the interfaces and a mesh point is placed at each
%   interface. The ODEs resulting from discretization in space are integrated
%   to obtain approximate solutions at times specified in the input array
%   TSPAN. The entries of TSPAN must satisfy
%       t0 = TSPAN(1) < TSPAN(2) < ... < TSPAN(NT) = tf
%   for some NT >= 3. The arrays XMESH and TSPAN do not play the same roles
%   in PDEPE: The time integration is done with an ODE solver that selects
%   both the time step and formula dynamically. The cost depends weakly on
%   the length of TSPAN. Second order approximations to the solution are made
%   on the mesh specified in XMESH. Generally it is best to use closely
%   spaced points where the solution changes rapidly. PDEPE does not select
%   the mesh in x automatically like it does in t; you must choose an
%   appropriate fixed mesh yourself. The discretization takes into account
%   the coordinate singularity at x = 0 when m > 0, so it is not necessary to
%   use a fine mesh near x = 0 for this reason. The cost depends strongly on
%   the length of XMESH.
%
%   The solution is returned as a multidimensional array SOL. UI = SOL(:,:,i)
%   is an approximation to component i of the solution vector u for
%   i = 1:npde. The entry UI(j,k) = SOL(j,k,i) approximates UI at
%   (t,x) = (TSPAN(j),XMESH(k)).
%
%   SOL = PDEPE(M,PDEFUN,ICFUN,BCFUN,XMESH,TSPAN,OPTIONS) solves as above
%   with default integration parameters replaced by values in OPTIONS, an
%   argument created with the ODESET function. Only some of the options of
%   the underlying ODE solver are available in PDEPE - RelTol, AbsTol,
%   NormControl, InitialStep, and MaxStep. See ODESET for details.
%
%   [SOL,TSOL,SOLE,TE,IE] = PDEPE(M,PDEFUN,ICFUN,BCFUN,XMESH,TSPAN,OPTIONS)
%   with the 'Events' property in OPTIONS set to a function handle EVENTS,
%   solves as above while also finding where event functions g(t,u(x,t))
%   are zero. For each function you specify whether the integration is to
%   terminate at a zero and whether the direction of the zero crossing
%   matters. These are the three column vectors returned by EVENTS:
%   [VALUE,ISTERMINAL,DIRECTION] = EVENTS(M,T,XMESH,UMESH).
%   XMESH contains the spatial mesh and UMESH is the solution at the mesh
%   points. Use PDEVAL to evaluate the solution between mesh points.
%   For the I-th event function: VALUE(I) is the value of the function,
%   ISTERMINAL(I) = 1 if the integration is to terminate at a zero of this
%   event function and 0 otherwise. DIRECTION(I) = 0 if all zeros are to be
%   computed (the default), +1 if only zeros where the event function is
%   increasing, and -1 if only zeros where the event function is decreasing.
%   Output TSOL is a column vector of times specified in TSPAN, prior to
%   first terminal event. SOL(j,:,:) is the solution at T(j). TE is a vector
%   of times at which events occur. SOLE(j,:,:) is the solution at TE(j) and
%   indices in vector IE specify which event occurred.
%
%   If UI = SOL(j,:,i) approximates component i of the solution at time TSPAN(j)
%   and mesh points XMESH, PDEVAL evaluates the approximation and its partial
%   derivative Dui/Dx at the array of points XOUT and returns them in UOUT
%   and DUOUTDX:  [UOUT,DUOUTDX] = PDEVAL(M,XMESH,UI,XOUT)
%   NOTE that the partial derivative Dui/Dx is evaluated here rather than the
%   flux. The flux is continuous, but at a material interface the partial
%   derivative may have a jump.
%
%   Example
%         x = linspace(0,1,20);
%         t = [0 0.5 1 1.5 2];
%         sol = pdepe(0,@pdex1pde,@pdex1ic,@pdex1bc,x,t);
%     solve the problem defined by the function pdex1pde with the initial and
%     boundary conditions provided by the functions pdex1ic and pdex1bc,
%     respectively. The solution is obtained on a spatial mesh of 20 equally
%     spaced points in [0 1] and it is returned at times t = [0 0.5 1 1.5 2].
%     Often a good way to study a solution is plot it as a surface and use
%     Rotate 3D. The first unknown, u1, is extracted from sol and plotted with
%         u1 = sol(:,:,1);
%         surf(x,t,u1);
%     PDEX1 shows how this problem can be coded using subfunctions. For more
%     examples see PDEX2, PDEX3, PDEX4, PDEX5.  The examples can be read
%     separately, but read in order they form a mini-tutorial on using PDEPE.
%
%   See also PDEVAL, ODE15S, ODESET, ODEGET, FUNCTION_HANDLE.

%   The spatial discretization used is that of R.D. Skeel and M. Berzins, A
%   method for the spatial discretization of parabolic equations in one space
%   variable, SIAM J. Sci. Stat. Comput., 11 (1990) 1-32. The time
%   integration is done with ODE15S. PDEPE exploits the capabilities this
%   code has for solving the differential-algebraic equations that arise when
%   there are elliptic equations and for handling Jacobians with specified
%   sparsity pattern.

%   Elliptic equations give rise to algebraic equations after discretization.
%   Initial values taken from the given initial conditions may not be
%   "consistent" with the discretization, so PDEPE may have to adjust these
%   values slightly before beginning the time integration. For this reason
%   the values output for these components at t0 may have a discretization
%   error comparable to that at any other time. No adjustment is necessary
%   for solution components corresponding to parabolic equations. If the mesh
%   is sufficiently fine, the program will be able to find consistent initial
%   values close to the given ones, so if it has difficulty initializing,
%   try refining the mesh.
